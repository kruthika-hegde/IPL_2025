**IPL 2025 Data Analysis and Business Intelligence Project üèèüìä**
This repository hosts a comprehensive Data Analysis and Business Intelligence (BI) project focused on the Indian Premier League (IPL). The goal of this project is to collect, preprocess, and analyze historical IPL data to generate key performance indicators (KPIs), derive insights, and create an interactive Power BI dashboard, potentially centered around predicting or selecting the "Cricket Best 11" for the 2025 season.

**üöÄ Key Features**
1. End-to-End Data Pipeline: Covers data collection (web scraping), cleaning (Python), analysis (DAX), and visualization (Power BI).
2. Interactive Power BI Dashboard: Provides a visual, interactive platform for exploring player and team statistics.
3. Performance Metrics: Calculation of advanced cricket metrics using DAX measures and calculated columns.
4. Best 11 Selection Model: Analysis designed to identify an optimal playing XI based on historical performance data.
